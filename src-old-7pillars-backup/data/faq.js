    q: "How is this free? What's the catch?",
    a: "Safety features are free forever. We charge for optional premium features like advanced scheduling and analytics. We make money from convenience, not protection."
  },
  {
    q: "What happens to my real identity?",
    a: "ChainPass verifies your ID, creates your V.A.I., then Vairify only sees your V.A.I. number — never your real name, address, or ID. Zero-knowledge architecture means we literally can't see your identity."
  },
  {
    q: "What if someone tries to find out who I am?",
    a: "They'd need court orders in three different countries (UK, US, Colombia) just to start. Our multi-jurisdiction structure makes identity exposure nearly impossible."
  },
  {
    q: "What's the Founding Council?",
    a: "500 members who get in first, get premium free forever, and vote on every major feature decision. Miss two votes? Privileges revoked. We're looking for people who show up."
  },
  {
    q: "Is this actually safe to use?",
    a: "Safer than anything else out there. DateGuard monitors your appointments. VAI-CHECK verifies who you're meeting. TrueRevu only allows reviews from verified encounters. All free."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use this if I'm traveling?",
    a: "Yes. Vairify works anywhere with internet. Your V.A.I. travels with you, and our verification works globally."
  },
  {
    q: "What devices does this work on?",
    a: "iOS and Android apps, plus web access. All your data syncs across devices automatically."
  },
  {
    q: "How long does verification take?",
    a: "ChainPass verification takes about 5 minutes the first time. After that, each encounter verification takes seconds."
  },
  {
    q: "What if someone refuses to verify?",
    a: "Then you have your answer. Anyone who won't verify isn't worth the risk. That's the whole point."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I delete my account?",
    a: "Yes, anytime. Your V.A.I. gets permanently revoked, and your identity data is deleted from ChainPass within 30 days."
